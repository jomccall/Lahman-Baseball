# Lahman-Baseball
The Lahman Baseball database is an extensive one compiled by Sean Lahman and available online here: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/
The data dictionary can be found here: http://www.seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2016.txt
I've used this database, a notably well kept and updated one that you can tell is made by people who truly love the sport, to practice writing intermediate SQL queries.

## General Information
I've used this database to examine the success of players who came to the MLB from Tennessee Universities, to group data in order to look at things like average strikeouts per game by decade over time, and to look at what various metrics for "success" can pan out when you query and sort this large amount of data in various ways.

## Technologies
